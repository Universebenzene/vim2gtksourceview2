# vim2gtksourceview2 #

This is a simple python script that will convert a vim (gvim) theme (colorscheme) to a theme that will work with applications that use gtksourceview2.0.

I have tested this with the version of gedit that comes with Ubuntu Gutsy 7.10.

```
  ./vim2gtksourceview.py < input.vim > output.xml
```
